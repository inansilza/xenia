The story revolves around Haimanti, a young and educated woman who marries Sribilash, a progressive and idealistic man who supports her aspirations and independence. However, their marriage faces many challenges from their conservative and orthodox families, especially Sribilash's mother who disapproves of Haimanti's modern outlook and behavior. Haimanti also suffers from the pressure of conforming to the traditional role of a wife and a daughter-in-law, which conflicts with her own identity and desires. The story depicts how Haimanti struggles to balance her personal happiness and social obligations, and how she ultimately pays a tragic price for her courage and honesty.
 
Haimanti is a powerful and poignant story that exposes the hypocrisy and injustice of the patriarchal society that oppresses women and stifles their potential. It also showcases Tagore's mastery of storytelling, his deep insight into human nature, and his sympathy for the plight of women. Haimanti is a must-read for anyone who appreciates classic literature and social commentary.

One of the most striking aspects of Haimanti is the contrast between the characters of Haimanti and Sribilash. Haimanti is a strong and independent woman who does not hesitate to express her opinions and stand up for her rights. She is also a talented writer who publishes her stories and essays in magazines and newspapers. Sribilash, on the other hand, is a weak and indecisive man who fails to support his wife and defend her from his family's criticism. He is also a mediocre writer who relies on Haimanti's help and guidance for his work. He often feels insecure and jealous of Haimanti's success and popularity.
 
The story also highlights the irony and tragedy of Haimanti's situation. She marries Sribilash out of love and respect for his progressive ideals and values. She hopes to find a partner who will share her dreams and aspirations and encourage her growth and development. However, she soon realizes that Sribilash is not the man she thought he was. He is unable to live up to his own principles and expectations. He is also influenced by his mother's conservative and orthodox views and tries to impose them on Haimanti. He expects her to be a submissive and obedient wife who will sacrifice her own interests and ambitions for his sake. He also resents her for being more intelligent and successful than him.
 
The story ends with a shocking and heartbreaking twist. Haimanti decides to leave Sribilash and his family after they humiliate and insult her for writing a controversial article on women's rights. She writes a farewell letter to Sribilash, explaining her reasons and expressing her disappointment and sorrow. She also reveals that she is pregnant with his child and that she hopes he will be a better father than he was a husband. She then takes a train to Calcutta, where she plans to start a new life with her child. However, fate has other plans for her. She dies in a train accident, leaving behind her letter and her unborn child.
