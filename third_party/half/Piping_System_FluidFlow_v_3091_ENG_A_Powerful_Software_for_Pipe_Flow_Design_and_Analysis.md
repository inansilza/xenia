Piping System FluidFlow v. 3.09.1 ENG is available for free trial at [^1^]. To download the full version, users need to purchase a license from the official website or from authorized resellers.

Piping System FluidFlow v. 3.09.1 ENG comes with over 40 example systems of different pipe designs for various scenarios, such as tanks, pumps, valves, heat exchangers, sprinklers, fire hydrants, compressed air distribution and more[^1^]. Users can also import their own piping component files (.pcf) from various CAD tools such as SmartPlant 3D, CADWorx, Solidworks, Autodesk Inventor and more[^1^]. These example systems can help users to learn how to use the software and to get inspired by the possibilities of pipe flow design and analysis.
 
Some of the example systems that users can explore with Piping System FluidFlow v. 3.09.1 ENG are:
 
- Three Reservoirs: This system models the flow of water from three reservoirs with different elevations and pressures to a common outflow point[^1^]. Users can calculate the flow rate and pressure at each point in the system and compare the results with analytical solutions.
- Chilled Water Campus Cooling: This system models the cooling of a campus building with chilled water supplied by a central plant[^1^]. Users can model the heat transfer between the water and the building, as well as the pressure losses due to pipe fittings, valves and elevation changes.
- Fire Protection Water Mist: This system models the fire protection of a room with water mist nozzles[^1^]. Users can model the spray characteristics of the nozzles, as well as the pressure losses due to pipe fittings, valves and friction.
- Compressed Air Distribution: This system models the distribution of compressed air from a compressor to various demand points[^2^]. Users can model the compressibility and viscosity of air, as well as the pressure losses due to pipe fittings, valves and leakage.
- Geothermal Heating from a Pond Loop: This system models the geothermal heating of a house with fluid circulating underwater through polyethylene piping in a closed loop[^2^]. Users can model the heat transfer between the fluid and the pond, as well as the pressure losses due to pipe fittings, valves and friction.

Piping System FluidFlow v. 3.09.1 ENG is a powerful software for pipe flow design and analysis that can handle complex and realistic scenarios with ease and accuracy. It is a must-have tool for engineers who want to optimize their pipe flow systems and save time and money.
