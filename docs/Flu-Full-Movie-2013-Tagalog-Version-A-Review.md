## Plot
 
The film begins with a group of illegal immigrants being smuggled into South Korea in a shipping container. However, one of them is infected with a mysterious virus that causes severe respiratory symptoms and hemorrhagic fever. The virus quickly spreads to the other immigrants and kills them all, except for a young girl named Monssai (Park Min-ha).
 
Monssai manages to escape from the container and wanders around the city of Bundang, where she is found by Kang Ji-koo (Jang Hyuk), a rescue worker who lives with his mother and his daughter Mirre (Kim Hyeon-sook). Ji-koo takes Monssai to a local clinic, where he meets Kim In-hae (Soo Ae), a doctor and a single mother who works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
 
In-hae suspects that Monssai is carrying a new strain of avian influenza, and alerts her colleague Cha In-pyo (Yoo Hae-jin), who is in charge of the emergency response team. However, before they can isolate Monssai, she runs away with Ji-koo and Mirre, who have grown fond of her.
 
Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread throughout Bundang, infecting thousands of people and causing panic and chaos. The government declares a state of emergency and quarantines the city, blocking all exits and cutting off all communications. The CDC tries to find a cure for the virus, but faces resistance from the politicians and the military, who have their own agendas.
 
As the situation worsens, Ji-koo and In-hae join forces to protect Monssai, who may be the key to stopping the epidemic. They also have to deal with their own personal issues, such as Ji-koo's estranged relationship with his father (Lee Hee-joon), who is a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and In-hae's ex-husband (Ma Dong-seok), who is a journalist who wants to expose the truth behind the outbreak.
